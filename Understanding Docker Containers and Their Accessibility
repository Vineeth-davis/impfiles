Understanding Docker Containers and Their Accessibility
Where Docker Containers Run:
Host System:
Docker containers run on the host system where Docker is installed. They use the host's operating system kernel but are isolated from other processes and containers.
Access to System Drives and File Structure:
Isolation:

By default, Docker containers are isolated from the host system's file structure. They only have access to the files and directories that are explicitly mounted into the container.
You can share directories between the host and the container using volumes or bind mounts, but this has to be configured intentionally.
Mounting Volumes:

Volumes: Managed by Docker and are stored in a location determined by Docker. They are designed to persist data outside of the container’s lifecycle.
Bind Mounts: Map a directory from the host filesystem into the container. This allows containers to access and modify files on the host system.
Modifying Container Files:
Within the Container:

Users can make modifications to files within the running container. These changes persist only as long as the container is running.
Once the container is stopped and removed, any changes to the filesystem inside the container are lost unless they are stored in a volume or bind mount.
Persistence:

To persist changes, you need to use Docker volumes or bind mounts. This way, data can be shared between the host and the container, and modifications can be retained across container restarts.
Computing Resources for Containers:
Host Machine:

The host machine provides the computing resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) required by the Docker containers.
Docker containers share the host machine’s kernel but operate in isolated environments. Resource limits can be set to control how much CPU and memory each container can use.
Resource Management:

CPU and Memory Limits: You can specify limits on how much CPU and memory a container can use using Docker’s resource management options (--cpus, --memory).
Cgroups and Namespaces: Docker uses control groups (cgroups) and namespaces to provide isolation and resource management for containers.
Practical Implications for Your Project
With Dockerization:
Isolation and Security:

Containers run isolated from the host system, enhancing security. Only explicitly shared directories are accessible to containers.
This isolation helps prevent accidental or malicious modifications to the host system.
Data Persistence:

Use Docker volumes to store MySQL data files, Redis data, and other important data that need to persist across container restarts.
Volumes ensure data is not lost when containers are updated or re-deployed.
Modifying Code:

If clients have access to the container, they can modify files within the container. However, these changes are temporary unless persisted through volumes.
With Executable (.exe):
Single File Deployment:

The executable runs on the client’s host machine and has access to the file system as per the permissions granted to it.
Modifications to the executable’s environment are directly on the host system, which can lead to configuration drift and potential security issues.
Limited Persistence:

Data persistence needs to be handled explicitly, typically outside of the executable, which can complicate setup and data management.
Example Scenario: Docker vs. Executable for Your Project
Docker:
Frontend (Vue.js):

Runs in a container, isolated from the host, accessible via specified ports (e.g., localhost:43210).
Static files can be served from a volume to persist updates.
Backend (Django):

Runs in its container, isolated from the host, accessible via specified ports (e.g., localhost:43211).
Code updates are managed through Docker image rebuilds and redeployments.
Data (MySQL):

Runs in a separate container with its data stored in a Docker volume, ensuring persistence.
Python and Dependencies:

Bundled in the Django container, ensuring consistent dependencies across environments.
Redis:

Runs in a separate container, isolated and managed via Docker.
Scripts (.bat, .ps1):

Included in the relevant containers and executed as needed.
Logs:

Managed using Docker volumes or bind mounts, ensuring logs are persisted and accessible.
Executable (.exe):
Single File:
Distributes all necessary components, including Python and dependencies, in one file.
Data and Redis Management:
More challenging to manage databases and Redis within an executable. External setup may be required.
Scripts and Logs:
Managed within the executable or through external configurations, leading to potential complexity in updates and maintenance.
Conclusion
Dockerization:

Pros: Offers isolation, consistency, easier updates, better resource management, and scalability. Volumes ensure data persistence.
Cons: Source code can be accessed if someone has access to the container. Requires Docker setup and management knowledge.
Executable (.exe):

Pros: Simple distribution as a single file, minimal setup required by the client.
Cons: Harder to update, less efficient resource management, more difficult to manage databases and scripts, and easier to reverse-engineer.
Given your project’s components and needs, Dockerization provides better overall management and scalability, with the trade-off of needing clients to have Docker installed and some understanding of how to use it. However, for hiding source code, neither method offers complete protection, and additional measures like code obfuscation or compiled languages might be necessary.
