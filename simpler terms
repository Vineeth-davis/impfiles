Yes, it is possible to limit who can access the running container and its contents, while still allowing all users to use the services provided by the container. Here's a simpler breakdown of how you can achieve this:

Concept Overview
Restricted Access to Containers:

Ensure only authorized users (those with the username and password) can manage the container (start, stop, or access it).
Ordinary users can still access the services running inside the container but cannot directly interact with the container itself or view its contents.
Service Access:

All users within the client site can use the service (e.g., a web application hosted by Django) provided by the container without needing access to the container.
