Based on the information you've provided, I can't access the specific image you're referring to. However, I can give you a general solution on how to implement user permissions for your Field model in Django REST framework, ensuring by-default access and allowing retrieval of users with access.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Models:

Python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class Field(models.Model):
    # ... your existing fields for Field

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Field {self.id}"

class FieldPermission(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    field = models.ForeignKey(Field, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ("user", "field")
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Explanation:

We've added a FieldPermission model to link User instances with the Field objects they have permission to access.
The unique_together meta option ensures a user can only have one permission record for a specific Field.
2. Serializers:

Python
from rest_framework import serializers

class FieldSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Field
        fields = "__all__"

class FieldPermissionSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    user = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='user.username')
    field = FieldSerializer()

    class Meta:
        model = FieldPermission
        fields = ("id", "user", "field")
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Explanation:

The FieldSerializer serializes Field model instances.
The FieldPermissionSerializer serializes FieldPermission model instances, including the username of the user and the nested Field serializer.
3. Permissions:

Python
from rest_framework.permissions import BasePermission, IsAuthenticated

class IsFieldPermitted(BasePermission):
    """
    Custom permission to check if a user has access to a specific Field.
    """

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        if request.method in permissions.SAFE_METHODS:
            return True  # Allow GET, HEAD, OPTIONS for everyone

        field_id = view.kwargs.get("pk")
        if not field_id:
            return False  # Require specific Field ID for write operations

        if request.user.is_authenticated:
            return FieldPermission.objects.filter(user=request.user, field_id=field_id).exists()
        else:
            return False  # Non-authenticated users cannot modify or delete

class FieldAdminPermission(BasePermission):
    """
    Permission to restrict Field administration to staff users.
    """

    def has_permission(self, request, view):
        return request.user.is_staff
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Explanation:

We've created two custom permissions:
IsFieldPermitted: This checks if the currently authenticated user has permission to access a specific Field instance (based on FieldPermission records). It allows GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS for everyone by default.
FieldAdminPermission: This restricts administrative operations on Field (presumably through a viewset) to staff users only.
4. ViewSets:

Python
from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet

class FieldViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Field.objects.all()
    serializer_class = FieldSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsFieldPermitted]  # Default permission

    def get_permissions(self):
        if self.action in ["destroy", "update", "partial_update"]:
            # Override permission for update/delete to require admin access
            return [IsAuthenticated & FieldAdminPermission()]
        return super().get_permissions()
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Explanation:

The FieldViewSet handles CRUD operations for Field instances.
By default, it uses the IsFieldPermitted permission class, allowing everyone to view fields but requiring permission for modifications.
The get_permissions method overrides permissions for update and delete actions, requiring both authentication and FieldAdminPermission (staff status).
5. Assigning User Permissions (API):

You can create a separate API endpoint to manage user permissions for fields. Here's an example:

Python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Field, FieldPermission

class AssignFieldPermissionView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated & FieldAdminPermission]  #
Use code with caution.
